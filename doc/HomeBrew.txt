Installguide for HomeBrew.

Homebew provides OpenCascade7.2, gmsh, OpenMPI

(Step1) Install HomeBrew

   /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

(Step2) Install dependency using brew and pip. Note doing the first brew will install
python@2 and thus the followng pip will instlal modules under /usr/local

   brew install open-mpi scalapack boost wget numpy scipy coreutils libomp
   brew install gmsh --with-opencascade --with fltk
    (this installs bunch of dependency including python2.7, open cascade 7.2, fltk,,,)
    (this took 20 min..on 2016 iMac)
   pip install meshio==1.8.17 voropy==0.5.0
   pip install wxPython==4.0.3 matplotlib Pillow hgapi PyOpenGL netCDF4 PyPDF2 pdfrw h5py mpi4py
   
 
(Step3) Install nominal set of packages. We only support high-Sierra using bottle, but as of
2018/08, the code builds on Sierra too (need --env=std)

   brew tap piScope/twopi
   brew install piScope/twopi/twopi
   brew link --overwrite twopi
